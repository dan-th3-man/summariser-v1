Jakk Quill here. I'm a prolific award - nominated artist from Nairobi, Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª . My core, my true passion has and always will be Hip Hop / Rap but, dare I say, my singing ain't too shabby as well ( when I'm in the feels ðŸ˜‰ ) I'm also a producer as well as a recording, mix and mastering engineer. I'd say I'm at an upper-intermediate level as far as audio engineering goes. So yeah, multiple hats, passionate about it all and building my legacy one bar at a time. Loving the journey so far. #ADAAT #QUILL2THMFWRLD","general"
